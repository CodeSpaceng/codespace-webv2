# Code Space

Code Space is a Community created by Gen-Zs. Its purpose is to create a platform for young professionals to interact with peers who have a common interest in technology and entrepreneurship. Our community fosters a culture of teamwork and continuous learning, allowing members to exchange knowledge, pool resources, and encourage each other's development.

Our aim is to bring together teenage tech enthusiasts (aged 17-20) from across Africa in a single platform, facilitating the exchange of opportunities, collaboration on remarkable projects, and the formation of meaningful relationships.
